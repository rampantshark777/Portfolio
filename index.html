    <h1>CS1300 Portfolio</h1>
</div>

<h2>Portfolio Introduction</h2>
<p class="intro">
    In each assigned project, I aimed to pick a topic that I either interact with on a regular basis, have a strong
    passion for, or both. I wanted this to be the case in order for the work to feel meaningful. Furthermore,
    improving an interface that I know to have a real-world effect on people makes the process worthwhile.
    </br>
    </br>
    While each project focuses on a different aspect of UI/UX, the overall objective to improve the user's experience
    by prioritizing simplicity and efficiency remains the same. It is this emphasis on thoughtfulness and empathy that
    I feel makes UI/UX special and attempted to embody in order to study and improve interfaces that I find meaningful.

                    To better understand potential issues of an interface, we can observe real user interactions and create realistic
                    user interactions. This gives us insight into how to improve an interface and create the most effective user
                    experience for a variety of different users.

                <p class="centerText">
                    In the Personas project, I chose the CVS self-checkout station, an
                    interface I interact with on a regular basis given its favorable location.

                    Small businesses often lack the resources and expertise to build a user-friendly interface. By focusing on improving
                    the memorability, readability, and usability aspects, we can rebuild an interface to ensure that user experience
                    is prioritized.

                    I chose to redesign Maharani Indian Cuisine, a local restaurant in my hometown that I frequented
                    often and has come to remind me of home.

                    A major aspect of UI/UX is adjusting an interface based off of new observations, criticisms, and suggestions.
                    In this Iterative Design project, my group and I aimed to take a recently founded startup and build a design
                    that effectively accomplishes their goal. Our startup is called Trendex, a company dedicated to allowing users to
                    invest in celebrities.

                <p class="centerText">
                    As an Applied Math-Computer Science concentrator, I felt passionate about this project; the product
                    lies right at the intersection of these two fields as statistics and development were the two main aspects of our
                    design.

                    Creating an interface that is useful to users is paramount in UI/UX. In this project, I created a way for
                    users to aggregate statistics about certain soccer players (specifically age and goals scored). The idea in this
                    project is to be able to save the user time by making calculations behind the scenes and simply presenting a final
                    product in a clear, understandable manner.

                <p class="centerText">
                    My decision to aggregate soccer statistics was influenced by what I felt
                    I would find useful. As a passionate fan of the game, creating a page that would provide me with insights about players
                    is something I find meaningful; while this project represent just a start given the time constraint, the potential
                    for what an expanded version of this interface could be is visible.
